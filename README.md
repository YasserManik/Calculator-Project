## Project Overview

This Python Calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program validates user inputs, handles division by zero, and ensures invalid operators or numbers are properly managed.

## Features
* **Basic Arithmetic**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
* **Error Handling**:
    * Validates numerical input to ensure it's a valid number.
    * Handles division by zero to prevent runtime errors.
    * Ensures only valid operators are accepted.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator.git
        cd python-calculator

2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine. No additional libraries are required.

## Usage

To run the calculator program, simply execute the following command:

        python calculator.py

## Example

        Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
        Enter the first number: 7
        Enter the second number: 3
        The result is 21.0

Handling Invalid Input:

        Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): &
        Enter the first number: 5
        Enter the second number: 10
        Error: '&' is not a valid operator.

Handling Division by Zero:

        Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
        Enter the first number: 10
        Enter the second number: 0
        Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
